 This description summarizes the key steps and logic of the algorithm:

Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm for Maximum Flow
Input: A directed graph G(V, E) with a capacity C[u][v] for each edge from vertex u to vertex v, a source vertex s, and a sink vertex t.

Output: The maximum flow from source s to sink t.

Initialize Graph:
V: Number of vertices in the graph.
graph[][]: Adjacency matrix where graph[u][v] represents the capacity of the edge from u to v.
Setup:
Create a residual graph residualGraph[][] from the input graph, initially set to the same capacities as graph[][].
max_flow: Initialize to 0, this will store the result - the total maximum flow from source to sink.
Augmenting Path Search using BFS:
Define function bfs(residualGraph, source, sink, parent) to find an augmenting path from source to sink:
Use a boolean array visited[] to keep track of visited vertices.
Use a queue for BFS, starting by enqueuing the source vertex and marking it as visited.
Traverse the graph level by level until you either reach the sink or exhaust all possible paths.
If a path is found to the sink, record the path by updating the parent[] array and return true.
If no path is found, return false.

Main Loop of Ford-Fulkerson:

While bfs() finds an augmenting path:
Determine the minimum capacity (path_flow) along the path found by bfs() (this is the bottleneck of the current path).
Update the residual capacities of the edges and reverse edges along the path:
Decrease the capacity of the forward edges by path_flow.
Increase the capacity of the reverse edges by path_flow (to allow the possibility of undoing this flow in future iterations).
Add path_flow to max_flow.
Output Result:
Print or return the max_flow which now contains the maximum flow from source to sink.
End of Algorithm
This description abstracts the process of finding the maximum flow in a network using the Ford-Fulkerson method, emphasizing the critical parts like initializing the residual graph, searching for augmenting paths using BFS, updating the residual capacities, and calculating the total maximum flow. This high-level view is beneficial for understanding the algorithm's logic without delving into the specific details of C++ syntax.

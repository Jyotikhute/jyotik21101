Algorithm:

1. Define a function removeKdigits that takes two parameters: num (string) and k (integer), and returns a string.
2. Check if k is greater than or equal to the length of num. If true, return "0" because removing k digits from num would result in an empty string or "0".
3. Create an empty stack to store digits.
4. Iterate through each digit in the input num:
While the stack is not empty, k is greater than 0, and the current digit is smaller than the top digit of the stack, pop the stack and decrement k. This step ensures that the remaining digits in the stack form the smallest possible number.
Push the current digit onto the stack.
5. If there are remaining digits to remove (k > 0), pop k digits from the stack to remove them.
6. Construct the result string by popping digits from the stack and appending them to the front of the result string.
7. Remove leading zeros from the result string.
8. If the resulting string is empty, return "0". Otherwise, return the resulting string.

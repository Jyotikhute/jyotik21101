Input:

Read an integer n representing the size of the grid.
Create a grid of size n x n called grid.
Input Elements:

Iterate over each row i from 0 to n-1.
Within each row, iterate over each column j from 0 to n-1.
Input the value for each element of the grid and store it in the corresponding position in the grid.
Process the Grid:

Call the preprocess_grid function, passing the grid and the size n.
This function preprocesses the grid by converting it into a grid of unsigned int values where each bit represents the presence or absence of a building.
Count Subgrids:

Call the count_subgrid function, passing the preprocessed grid and the size n.
This function counts the number of subgrids formed by buildings by comparing each pair of rows in the grid.
Output the Result:

Print the result obtained from counting the subgrids.
End of Program:

Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.

1. Initialize variables patches, 'i', and 'sz'. patches is used to count the number of patches added, 'i' is the index of the current element in the array, and 'sz' is the size of the array.
2. Initialize a variable 'count' to 1, representing the maximum reachable sum using the elements seen so far.
3. Iterate until count is greater than 'n':
If 'i' is within the range of 'nums' and 'nums[i]' is less than or equal to 'count', update count by adding 'nums[i]' to it, and increment 'i'.
If 'nums[i]' is greater than count or 'i' is out of range, it means there's a gap between the reachable sum and the next number. To fill this gap, multiply 'count' by 2 and increment 'patches'.
4.Return the number of 'patches' added ('patches').
This algorithm ensures that any number in the range [1, n] can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.

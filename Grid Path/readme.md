Obtain the grid itself and its size, n, as input. Start: To keep track of the number of pathways for every cell, use a 2D array. Verify Base Cases: Make sure there are no traps in the beginning or finishing cells. Return 0 if they are. Navigate the Grid: Go through every grid cell once. Count Paths: Avoid a cell if it contains a trap. If the cell before it is reachable and it is in the first row or column, then set its path count to 1. Set the path count of other cells to the total of the paths from the left and above cells. The number of pathways from the upper-left cell to the lower-right cell is returned as the output.
